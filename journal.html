      I saw some Burma Shave style sings on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passingcars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      of eternty. <br>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
      I defintelywon't be passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got 
      everythng packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, 
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
          cell phone
          iPod
          digital camera
          and a protien bar
          Just the essentials.As
          Lao Tzu would have said, <q>>A journey of a
          thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
